# Linked-List-CS-302
Implementation of a Linked List in C++ with TODO list application

Project Guidelines:

Using C++ object oriented programming methods, create a TODO app.

The program should provide a menu of choices that the user can use to do basic operations on the TODO list
such as a) adding a new task, b) delete an task, c) show all tasks, d) remove all tasks, or simply to exit.
